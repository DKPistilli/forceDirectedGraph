Extra Features

1) Spacebar Reset: Pressing spacebar will reset the graph in case nodes
                   leave the screen or you simply want to find new node
                   positions.

2) j/k framerate: Pressing j will lower the framerate (k will raise) which
                  can be used to model a change in the rate of time,
                  allowing user to see visual fx and data at different
                  speeds.

3) Smoke Trail: Each node will leave behind a trail when being dragged by
                the mouse. This trail helps illustrate to the user which
                node they are currently interacting directly with.

4) System Info: In the top left corner of the screen, we display some of
                the relevant system info like fps, total kinetic energy,
                and whether or not the system is currently 'updating' the
                positions of the nodes or whether the total remaining
                energy is less than the threshold required for update.

5) NEBULA: Have you ever looked up towards the sky and questioned your
           place in the universe? We are but grains of sand in the vastness
           of our universe. Press 's' to delve deeper into the final
           frontier. Once there, press 'r' to control space like only the
           Gods themselves were meant to do.
