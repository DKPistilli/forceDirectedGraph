This graph was built in processing to follow the Comp150-Visualization
assignment spec for Assignment3. For details on individual roles and extra
features implemented outside of what's required in the spec, read the other
files (team.txt && extracredit.txt).

Known Bugs:

ToDo:
    - Alter the push/pop matrix functionality so that the dragging and
      hovering of nodes correctly functions when in nebula mode.
    - Clean up the code to make it way more simmple && easy to read.
    - Add globals to their own tab
